## Qt
Qt is set of cross-platform C++ libraries that implement high-level APIs for accessing many aspects of modern desktop and mobile systems. These include location and positioning services, multimedia, NFC and Bluetooth connectivity, a Chromium based web browser, as well as traditional UI development. <br />

### Qt for Python
Qt for Python offers the official Python bindings for Qt, and has two main components: <br />
- `PySide6`, so that you can use Qt6 APIs in your Python applications
- `Shiboken6`, a binding generator tool, which can be used to expose C++ projects to Python, and a Python module with some utility functions. <br />
Porting from PySide2 to PySide6 provides information on porting existing PySide2 applications. <br />

## QtGui
The Qt GUI module provides classes for windowing system integration, event handling, OpenGL and OpenGL ES integration, 2D graphics, basic imaging, fonts and text. These classes are used internally by Qt's user interface technologies and can also be used directly, for instance to write applications using low-level OpenGL ES graphics APIs. <br />
For application developers writing user interfaces, Qt provides higher level API's, like Qt Quick, that are much more suitable than the enablers found in the Qt GUI module.

## PyQt5
PyQt5 is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5. It is implemented as more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and Android. <br /> PyQt5 may also be embedded in C++ based applications to allow users of those applications to configure or enhance the functionality of those applications.
